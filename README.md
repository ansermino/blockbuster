This is an implementation of the classic Brick Breaker in NIOS assembly. This game has been tested on the Altera DE1. The controller for the game is the Lego controller documented [here](http://www-ug.eecg.utoronto.ca/desl/nios_devices_SoC/dev_newlegocontroller2.html), using two touch sensors for left and right movement. The VGA adapter on the DE1 is utilized for output.

## Features
- Multi-difficulty blocks
- Easily configurable block layouts
- Sound effects using a sin wave approximation
- Game win/loss and reset functionality
